# Soil-Classification-Challenge

##  Soil Image Classification Challenge (IIT Ropar, Annam.ai)

This repository contains our complete solutions to two soil image classification challenges hosted by [Annam.ai](https://annam.ai) at **IIT Ropar**. The primary goal was to develop high-performing deep learning models to accurately classify soil images, maximizing **F1-score** for balanced predictions.

##  Competition Results

- **Challenge 1 (Multiclass):**  
  - **Kaggle Rank:** 18th  
  - **Best F1-score:** 1.0000

- **Challenge 2 (Binary):**  
  - **Kaggle Rank:** 24th  
  - **Best F1-score:** 0.9751

---

##  Project Structure

- `Soil Classification Challenge 1/`  
  Multiclass classification of soil images into four types: *Alluvial*, *Black*, *Clay*, and *Red*.

- `Soil Classification Challenge 2/`  
  Binary classification: Soil vs. Non-Soil images, with special focus on handling class imbalance.

Each folder contains:
- All code, Jupyter notebooks, and `README.md` for that specific challenge.
- Example requirements and setup instructions.
- Datasets and submission templates (see inside respective folders).

## üèÜ Highlights

- **Challenge 1:** Achieved a perfect F1-score of 1.0 across all soil classes using a fine-tuned ResNet18 model.
- **Challenge 2:** Addressed class imbalance by manually augmenting the dataset with non-soil images, significantly improving generalization and reducing false positives.

## üß† Project Logic & Approach

### Challenge 1: Four-Class Soil Classification

- **Preprocessing:**  
  - All images resized to 224x224.  
  - Applied augmentations: flips, rotation, normalization.
- **Dataset:**  
  - Custom PyTorch `SoilDataset` class, labels from CSV.
- **Model:**  
  - Pretrained ResNet18, last layer adapted for 4 classes.
- **Training:**  
  - CrossEntropyLoss, Adam optimizer, F1-score monitored per class.
  - Best model checkpointed based on validation F1.
- **Prediction:**  
  - Test set inference, submission CSV generated.

### Challenge 2: Soil vs. Non-Soil (Binary Classification)

- **Problem:**  
  - Binary task (`1`: Soil, `0`: Not Soil).  
  - Training set had only soil images; non-soil images added manually for generalization.
- **Model:**  
  - Pretrained ResNet18, last FC layer changed to binary output.
  - BCEWithLogitsLoss, Adam optimizer.
- **Augmentation:**  
  - Flips, color jitter, rotation.
- **Evaluation:**  
  - F1-score used for model selection and validation.
- **Submission:**  
  - `submission.csv` with image_id and predicted label.
